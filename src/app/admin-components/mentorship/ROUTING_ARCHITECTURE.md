# Mentorship Component Routing Architecture

## Overview

The Mentorship component has been refactored from a tab-based conditional rendering system to a proper Angular routing architecture. This follows the same pattern as the AdminComponent, making it more scalable and maintainable.

## Architecture Changes

### Before (Tab-based with *ngIf)
- Single component with tab state management
- Conditional rendering using `*ngIf` statements
- All child components were always imported and rendered conditionally
- Tab switching was handled by component state

### After (Router-based with Child Routes)
- Parent shell component with `<router-outlet>`
- Child routes for each mentorship section
- Lazy loading of child components
- Tab navigation through Angular Router

## New Route Structure

```
/admin/mentorship
├── /overview (default)
├── /templates
├── /sessions
├── /tasks
└── /analytics
```

## Files Modified/Created

1. **mentorship.component.ts** - Converted to shell component with router navigation
2. **mentorship-routing.module.ts** - New routing module (optional, using loadComponent instead)
3. **app.routes.ts** - Updated with child routes for mentorship

## Key Benefits

1. **Better Performance**: Lazy loading of components means only the active tab is loaded
2. **URL Navigation**: Each tab has its own URL, enabling bookmarking and direct navigation
3. **Browser History**: Back/forward navigation works naturally
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add new tabs without modifying the parent component
5. **Separation of Concerns**: Each child component is completely independent
6. **Memory Efficiency**: Inactive components are not kept in memory

## Component Communication

- **Tab Counts**: The `updateTabCount()` method is maintained for backward compatibility
- **Navigation**: Uses `[routerLink]` directives instead of click handlers
- **Active State**: `routerLinkActive` directive handles active tab styling

## Usage

The mentorship component now works as an app shell:

1. Navigate to `/admin/mentorship` - redirects to `/admin/mentorship/overview`
2. Click tabs to navigate between different routes
3. Each tab maintains its own state independently
4. URLs are bookmarkable and shareable

## Migration Notes

- All child components remain unchanged and functional
- The shell component maintains the same styling and layout
- Tab counting functionality is preserved
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
